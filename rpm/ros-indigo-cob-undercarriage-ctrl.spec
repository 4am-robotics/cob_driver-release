%description
cob_undercarriage_ctrl implements a controller for the omnidirectional base of
Care-O-bot 3 on joint level. For a given Pltf-Twist the according wheel steering
angles and linear wheel velocities are calculated based on the principle of
rigid body motion. Each joint is than controlled individually to achieve the
computed position and velocity
